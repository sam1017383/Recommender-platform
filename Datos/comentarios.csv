1,3,"So maybe I'm being a little harsh - after all, we were low-rent Priceline customers, right? Wrong. Well, I mean, we were low-rent Priceline customers, but I don't think that should ever be a reason for less than standard service - therefore, I have to conclude that even had we paid full rate, we would likely have received the same service, the same room. The combination of ho-hum service, marginal rooms, and sky-high prices was simply unacceptable. With an abundance of nearby lodging and dining alternatives, I don’t see any compelling reason to ever visit The Benson Hotel again. ",2016-02-10,14:00:02,4760,26586

3,5,"Overall, staying at the Poly was great. We ate a meal at the Yacht Club resort and we found it somewhat inconvenient to take a crowded bus to and from the Magic Kingdom after our own experiences of simply taking the monorail to the Magic Kingdom. In my opinion, it is worth the money to be so close to the theme parks.  
 
The Poly is a great place for everyone-honeymooners, couples, families, singles-everyone can appreciate the décor and everything the Poly has to offer.",2016-02-10,11:32:23,4607,28720

This is an expensive resort, no doubt about that. Going during the off season and joining the Disney Club will result in some reductions, but it's still not a place to go if you're on a tight budget.  ",2016-02-11,23:12:34,2449,34257

6,1,"As far as playing the slots, I didn't even bother. My decision to play in a casino is usually based on whether or not there's any noise. I didn't even hear a coin drop. For me that's not a good sign. The sound of coins, music, even people screaming (for winning of course) is the draw. Vegas is about excitement and the Riviera was lacking in that department.

8,4,"Also, one thing I love about Fremont Street (where the Nugget is located) is that everything is in close proximity. So you can go walk from hotel to hotel, without dying of heat prostration. I like to gamble at the Golden Gate (when I'm feeling cheap) because they have $3 tables. Also, the laser show on Fremont Street is really incredible - they have it every evening after dark. There are little kiosks with gifts, etc... up and down the street too. However, I would recommend not walking outside of Fremont Street as the surrounding areas are a little scary.  
 
I would definitely recommend the Golden Nugget ( oh, and did I mention free parking for hotel guests?) it's beautifully appointed, luxurious and if you hit it just right, cheap.",2016-02-14,12:04:32,4300,34812

11,3,"In the debate over whether to stay on-site or off-site while visiting Disney World and other Orlando-area attractions, I think if the choice were this motel or an off-site motel, I would go off-site where there are many more attractive lodgings for less money. I think anyone choosing to stay at the All Star Sports Resort would do well to rent a car. This place is pretty isolated from the most desirable sections of the Disney World complex.

15,4,"The whole decor of the casino and hotel seems to have frozen 10-15 years back in time. The rooms are OK. The parking lot for the hotel guests is the farthest I have ever seen. The casino is fairly large. They have some very nice shows if you are interested. The hotel may be considered on the strip 5 years back, not anymore. The ""REAL STRIP"" is where the new casinos like Paris, New York New York, Bellagio, Venetian, Mirage etc. are, which is quite far.  ",2016-02-17,10:30:12,3193,26927
16,5,Treasure Island has so much to offer it has to be one of the best on the Las Vegas Strip. We had so much fun here and found everything to be in great shape.

17,1,"There's a reason why this resort has consistently received top ratings from Conde Nast. It's hard to find much wrong with it. The service is friendly, accommodating and the employees go out of their way to make your vacation as perfect as it can possibly be. That attitude is what makes the Hyatt Regency Kauai special. Without that, all you have is the empty shell of a resort. It's the heart that makes the difference.  ",2016-02-19,9:22:23,2619,33860

19,2,"The resort area of the hotel is equally incredible. There is an adult pool, a pool with a waterslide as well as several hot tubs nestled between the waterfalls and tropical foliage. While these are beautiful themselves, I was highly impressed with the vast saltwater lagoon that is sprinkled with several small ""islands"" with their own hammocks swaying between palm trees.  
 
We ate at the ""Tidepools"" restaurant on the hotel property. The restaurants atmosphere was extremely romantic. We were seated in a gazebo like structure, sitting in the middle of a pond complete with Koi fish. The waiter suggested the grilled seafood platter. Our tastebuds were delighted with the luscious flavors of freshly grilled shrimp and lobster complimented by a tropical fruit salsa. The waiter did great with his suggestion to order that night's special.  
 
If you are ever fortunate enough to visit the beautiful island of Kauai, try to stay at the Hyatt Regency, you won't be disappointed.  ",2016-02-20,17:32:12,846,27513

Everyone always has a smile on their face. There is even a ""Greeter"" who is dressed as a ship's captain who says good morning and/or welcome to you every time you leave and come back!  
 
Some of the other services that they have are kid's programs at the Sandcastle Club, an Arcade, A health club and a barber/hairdresser salon. There are facilities right at your fingertips where you can rent boats, play tennis, volleyball or even croquet.  ",2016-02-20,23:12:34,1943,19311
21,4,"Okay, now that that is behind us, let's talk about the beauty of this hotel. The grounds are breathtaking. They landscaped it so that you feel as if you are in a tropical paradise. The best part of the grounds is the lagoon and pools. The pools are all freshwater. We're not talking about a standard rectangular pool - the pools are like meandering paths that curve around and go under foot bridges, under rock bridges, etc. The pools are on multiple levels with waterfalls between the levels. All around the pools are sun decks with lounge chairs. And then there is the lagoon. The lagoon is salt water with an artificial sand-like bottom. I say sand-like because the sand pieces are way too large to be natural sand. When I first saw this, I couldn't understand why they used it but it became apparent. When walking on it, it doesn't stick to your feet! The individual pieces are too big! How clever. Swimming in the lagoon was more fun than the pools, in my opinion, because it felt more like swimming in a natural setting. The deep end of the lagoon is also used for scuba diving classes.

I had no complaints at all about the Ritz-Carlton during my stay. The room was comfortable with everything I needed, the food was good, and the service prompt and polite.

I also recommend joining the Hyatt Gold Passport club, because you can also upgrade to the Cabins on the lake with you member points the price drops down to about $245 from $345 a night. You accrue, member points, with every stay at any Hyatt. Also, with your Gold passport card you get discounts in the Hotels gift shops.

29,1,"The Riviera is located on a part of the Strip that is removed from the more populated, safe, and ""happening"" areas, which are mid-Strip and South Strip. The Riviera is located on North Strip and is near the Stratosphere, Circus Circus, Slots-a-Fun, and Silver City. They are all old generation hotels and are a painful walk from the newer properties on the Strip. That part of the Strip is also palpably more seedy - on one occasion I witnessed a man standing next to a garbage can, removing a rubber arm tie from his arm, presumably after shooting up, judging by his appearance. Things like this really take away from a vacation.

31,4,"In conclusion, Danny and I enjoyed a fabulous vacation at Disney World. Of all the places I’ve visited in my lifetime, this was by far my most magical adventure. Disney will never be the same for me as it was that year. It was my first time, and my little brother is not so little anymore. Sometimes, now, when I look at his broad shoulders and baby soft facial hair; when I hear his deep, intelligent voice; when I watch him pull out of my mom’s driveway… I see a tired little boy dressed in mouse ears, waving flags on Main Street, collecting character autographs, and wildly giggling at the top of his ten-year-old lungs. I ache for that vacation all over again…  ",2016-02-25,11:32:23,2654,10684

33,4,"Don't get me wrong. Palace Station is a great place...if you're a local and like to gamble. You see, all of the promotions (money and prize giveaways) are geared towards the locals. They give prizes away, but while I was visiting, they were only giving them away weekly. So, if, like me, you arrive on a Saturday, and are leaving on Thursday, you miss the Friday drawings! Yikes! While playing there, I earned a bunch of free tickets to use to enter the drawings, but I had to be PRESENT TO WIN. What a letdown.  
 
With that said, the dealers are overall a pretty friendly lot. It appears they see a lot of regulars, so they welcome a fresh face now and then and ask genuine questions about you. ",2016-02-25,11:32:23,4210,31680

I was scheduled to stay for 6 nites, after 3 nites, I left. I was a female traveling by myself and did not feel safe here. I left and checked into The Hotel Royal Plaza on Hotel Plaza Boulevard where the Security was stepped up.

I only hope that this time it will not be 25 more years. It’s a great place for the entire family. Everyone is treated like they are the most important people there by all the staff. You are greeted with “Aloha!” by all the staff. Every question is answered in a quick and efficient manner. If you want reservations to a show or dinner they make you feel like they really want to make them for you.

38,1,"The minute that I pulled up to this hotel, I was awaited by the bell man in their proper blue jackets, welcoming us to one of the greatest cities in the country, San Francisco. This was my first time here, and I knew that staying at the Ritz would certainly not displease me, but the overall stay was much better than what I imagined. There was so much to do just inside the hotel that it made touring the city seem boring. First of all, there are many restaurants located throughout the large hotel. Anything from the garden restaurant, to the little lobby restaurant for tea and cookies, to the award winning dining room, voted the best in San Francisco. Though, beware, look at the prices before you order. Nothing here is cheap, but there is not doubt that it is worth it. After a long day of touring the city, why not go for a swim in the amazing health center? There is an indoor pool, masseuse, and an incredible exercise room fitting all of your needs. Then, stop by the concierge to get a recommendation for the best restaurants in town, if you want to leave the hotel of course. If you are not in the mood to leave your room, there are many hit movies to choose from, and room service is exquisite. Anything from a business trip to a family vacation, The Ritz can make anyone feel satisfied. This hotel has modern amenities, but still keeps the charm and luxury of historical San Francisco. This is certainly an extraordinary hotel which would make any stay in San Francisco an amazing one. ",2016-02-28,23:12:34,4796,10684

Not many may take the time to check out the resort because they're so busy wanting to see and do everything they can in Disney World, but I advise you as a potential future guest to walk through it and see what you can. From the moment you set foot through the door, you get a very cozy, inviting, warm feeling from the place and that feeling lasts the entire length of your stay. The service is great, you get a good night's rest, and as a resort guest are also treated to free refills on coffee after your initial purchase of a resort mug. Wilderness Lodge is an extremely well-done Disney resort, very relaxing, a treat to stay at, and you're guaranteed to have a great time in an already great vacation destination.

In August I stayed at the Nugget midweek for $39/night, with a $25 certificate for food in any of the hotel's restaurants.
